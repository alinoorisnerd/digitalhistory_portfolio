                Qatar digital library is a digital archive which houses multiple scans of manuscripts and documents, made available to the public. The site houses documents that cover the wider history of the gulf. The MENA region has a rich history. From vibrant cultures to history tainted with blood and colonialism, it has a past that cannot be and should not be over looked. Many of the most important global events took place in this region. Knowing the past helps predict the future, and an archive aids that endeavor.

                Historical Scholarship has evolved over time into incorporating many of the facets of the modern day and age. What was back then going back and forth between isles of book shelves, information access has now become much more convenient and faster thanks to the digitalization. Some might argue that lack of digitalization of certain non-western centered historical events had brought about digital divide, while some have argued that it to be the opposite.

                Be as it may, but going through an archive does require some effort. With greater quantity at hand, its no surprise that information over load can sometimes ‘derail’ us from the topic in hand. With this particular writing, we may consider the wider discourse on slavery and slave trade for instance. Upon querying the search bar for slavery and slave trade literally, it yields around 1,240 items available in its database.

                A huge number of text without a doubt! However, it is also true, like mentioned earlier, going through the heaps of books turned 1s and 0s is as if looking for a needle in a haystack! Therefore, information needs to be filtered down into certain desirable domain to meet our objective, such as a specific time, place, person, etc. Thanks to the filters provided on the website, users can toggle filters for specific categories of their liking. Not only that, but also, what I found most convenient was the ability to search for material listed under free to use with open license.

                Part of digital literacy and information literacy is to propagate authentic information and counter ‘link rot’ present online. To verify and cross check an information when in doubt, the website has a section with tips listed on searching and querying. Out of curiosity, I decided to check my very own name, and see if it was listed in any of the documents. Turns out, there was a match. While not related to the topic at hand, it is crucial to understand how to query to achieve faster and much precise information indexing.

                It would be fair, if the archive was really put to the test. Since the subcontinent and the Gulf have traded heavily in the past, it is much more likely, that a lot of people were traded here and there. However, I am curious to know the case of people from my city of ‘Lyallpur’. A textile city, with artificial irrigation, and very less known past. Since the beating heart of country’s economy, and not a dear member modern hub for tourism, it is rarely talked about in history books, unlike Lahore! Therefore, I applied the filters for slavery and slave trade, didn’t include the time frame and indexed using the keyword ‘Lyallpur’ and ‘Slave’.

                A shocker! Nothing returned! Apparently I got the system wrong. So I took the advice and tried again. This time around, the same happened! This made me realized, that either my city really is boring, or that the digital archive is missing out on files and information regarding that particular place. To be fair, it was ought to happen, since the archive is centered around gulf. Therefore, I decided to look in Christian Slave trade.

                A topic of controversy, but shines the light on attitude towards religious minorities in the Mena region. The search returned 8 different sources, which seemed rich in information. The closest I could come to was ‘Juddah and Aden Affairs’. A 1GB worth of PDF, containing salt trade and mistreatment of christian slaves. A time-worthy read!

            Yet still, I was disappointed to find nothing regarding my city. Not that I was eager to find that we traded slaves or something of such sort, but that there absolutely nothing to look for. This made me realize of the limitations of the website. Whilst the layout, availability of pdf and generous licensing makes this a wonderful archive, it still doesn’t answer all of the questions. Hence, I realized, that as a researcher, I was looking at the wrong place to begin with. A job of an archive is to house relevant information. Moving forward, I decided to use google instead. I did stumble upon few articles here and there, but after cross verification found out there is nothing till this date to begin with.

                Hence, finally settled, I realize that sometimes what we question isn’t there to being with. This made me appreciate the QDL archive for the efforts that have been put forth to preservation. The library houses almost all sorts of medium be it writing or photographs. In the future if they can incorporate media such as videos, will help capture the current age for the upcoming generations too.
                The reading ‘Juddah and Affairs’ did point me towards Bombay and business monopolies who exploited locals with slavery. I will look into that in the future.
