                Crowdsourcing has become a prevalent activity on the internet, where individuals contribute to causes or projects when needed. It can involve producing commodities or simply adding to a larger idea.

Many open-source software libraries and today’s used libraries are free and maintained by the community. In contrast, some software requires a subscription model. Therefore, the nature of crowdsourcing is not solely based on its cost-effectiveness, but rather on the fact that when the cause is greater than materialistic gains, people tend to interact, share ideas, and collaborate for the sake of it. The case of ‘Zooniverse’ exemplifies this phenomenon. An online platform that enables individuals from diverse backgrounds to contribute to research projects. Students, teachers, and those related to academia, regardless of their affiliation, gather on a single platform to expand upon existing knowledge.

                Zooniverse hosts a vast collection of data, categorized under various themes such as science and history. The sheer volume of data poses challenges for researchers in effectively labeling and categorizing it. Labeling data offers numerous benefits, including feeding it into artificial intelligence models for training and facilitating rapid identification using algorithmic sorting tools. On Zooniverse, the public can transcribe and identify data presented in the form of images and scans. The field that interests me the most is ‘history and religion.’

                However, I was unable to locate any projects or missions dedicated to the rich history of Pakistan, particularly Lahore. Out of the 26 projects available, the majority focus on American history. While this aligns with the Western initiative’s nature, it is concerning that so much information about Lahore’s rich heritage, the city renowned for its gardens, is being lost to future generations. 

The city, which was a hub for pivotal independence-related movements, artifacts, empires, and landmarks, also houses burial sites and significant historical markers. Notably, the site where Alexander the Great arrived with his formidable army has been transformed into a garbage dump area. This degradation is primarily attributed to historical neglect and the lack of widely known facts. Language barriers play a significant role in this neglect, as most online information is documented in English, while the majority of Pakistan’s population speaks Urdu due to limited education opportunities.

            <p>
                To address this issue, I propose a project on Zooniverse that aims to empower Urdu-speaking researchers and the general public to share their knowledge and contribute to the labeling of crucial images and events that are known only to previous generations. As each generation passes, rich historical heritage inevitably fades away, making it imperative to preserve it through innovative methods. Crowdsourcing emerges as the most suitable approach for this endeavor.

            <p>
                The project will encompass images, descriptions in both Urdu and English, and a timeframe indicating the event’s occurrence. To initiate the project, I intend to collaborate with Wikimedia Commons, which houses a wealth of historical photographs of Lahore. I will begin by posting images borrowed from Wikimedia Commons, which are accompanied by metadata, location information, and a date of capture. This metadata allows for the verification of pre-existing images with similar tags, facilitating the accuracy and reliability of the data.

            <p>
                Furthermore, I encourage individuals beyond the academic community to contribute to the project. Specifically, I seek to translate English-language works by colonizers and historical accounts into Urdu texts. For instance, the popular YouTuber “BaalWala” diligently documents the history of Lahore, but despite his contributions, categorized imagery labeled and categorized for use in data clusters remains lacking. Therefore, both written and visual formats are equally valuable in this project.

                While this activity may appear appealing, it carries certain challenges. Since the information has been transmitted verbally for generations, it is possible that it has become skewed over time. To verify its accuracy, we can refer to scripts and written data preserved in books. Many of the documented works are in English and require proper historical scholarship. If an ordinary person were to undertake this task, the transcribing process alone would be overwhelming. Therefore, there is a dilemma: how to balance the stories told by the common man and how to compare them with the degree of truth.

        <div class="pp"><p>
            Zooniverse offers a solution to this dilemma. The platform does not push or integrate information unless it aligns with the same idea reported by someone else. This approach addresses our concerns to some extent.

                Once the journey is completed, I intend to utilize the labeled data to train my own machine learning platform. We recently launched our app, which provides travel and navigation services. Google Maps-based data often contains irrelevant information. Therefore, with a trained model, we can provide tourists and, particularly locals, with more up-to-date and accurate guidelines for the places they plan to visit within Lahore. The model will quickly sort through the labeled data, refine it, and yield the most appropriate location that the user may want to visit. This data can also be uploaded to websites to allow students and researchers working on historic Lahore to avoid the inconvenience of navigating through numerous websites to find the best source of information, as Google’s poor indexing in other languages creates a digital divide.
